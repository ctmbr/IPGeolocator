For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. [This article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) gives a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.
 
2. CSS

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. [Learn more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics)

3. JAVASCRIPT

JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
